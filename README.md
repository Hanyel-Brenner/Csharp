# Csharp
C# projects in general
This project is a simple bank account simulator console app. Version 1.0 allows user to sign in or sign up and perform actions such as: 
1. See current balance
2. Withdrawal
3. Deposit
4. Transfer to another account

There is no database, so all the accounts are created in run-time and deleted after the end of the program. The "database" is a List.
